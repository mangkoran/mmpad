# MMPAD

MMPAD stands for "mangkoran Macro Pad", built with osu! in mind (lol).

## Backgrounds

I've started playing a rythm game osu! to kill time since the pandemic began.
Actually, I play osu! because it's the only game that I could ran in my Linux.
Then at some point in November, I'm thinking of buying a mechanical keyboard for osu!.
But holy f\*\*\* they are so damn expensive for my poor wallet. Then I remembered [herpiko's UNK](https://github.com/herpiko/unk)
and it inspires me to build a custom-handwired-mechanical keyboard.

## Objectives

- As cheap as possible
- Fully customizable (I mean, it's handwired)
- Compact, ideal for travelling (mobile gamer gang)
- Helps me reaching FC 5\* (lol)
